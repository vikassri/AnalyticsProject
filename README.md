## Architecture Overview

The platform ingests data from multiple sources including web and mobile apps, order systems, and inventory databases. It uses **Kafka** for real-time event streaming, **ksqlDB** for stream processing, and various sink connectors to deliver data to destinations like Elasticsearch, Redis, BigQuery, and custom alerting systems.

---

## Prerequisites

- A Confluent Cloud account with Kafka and Schema Registry enabled.
- API keys for all relevant services.
- Python 3.9+ with essential libraries installed.
- Docker (optional for containerized deployment).
- Access to destination systems (e.g., Elasticsearch, BigQuery).

---

## Environment Setup

The setup includes:
- Installing dependencies.
- Configuring environment variables for secure access.
- Initializing Kafka topics and schema registry.
- Preparing Docker and Kubernetes configurations for containerized deployments.

---

## Schema Design

The project defines **Avro schemas** for:
- Customer events
- Order events
- Inventory updates
- User profiles

Schemas are registered with the Schema Registry to ensure compatibility across services.

---

## Kafka Topics Configuration

Topics are created for all event types, each with optimal partitioning and replication settings to support scalability and fault tolerance.

---

## Data Producers Implementation

Event producers simulate or stream live data for:
- Customer interactions (clicks, views, searches)
- Orders and payments
- Inventory changes

They use Kafka producers with Avro serialization to push data into Confluent Cloud.

---

## ksqlDB Stream Processing

Real-time business logic is defined using **ksqlDB**, including:
- Revenue tracking by category
- Customer funnel analysis
- Fraud detection
- Low inventory alerts
- Popular product identification

---

## Kafka Streams Applications

Two critical microservices are implemented using Kafka Streams:
- **Recommendation Engine**: Builds collaborative filtering recommendations based on user interactions.
- **Fraud Detection**: Detects potentially fraudulent orders based on various heuristics.

---

## Connectors Configuration

Kafka Connect sink connectors are configured for:
- **Elasticsearch**: Indexing events for search and analytics
- **BigQuery**: Persistent analytics and dashboarding
- **Redis**: Real-time personalization caching
- **HTTP Webhooks**: Triggering external alert systems

---

## Monitoring and Testing

Monitoring includes:
- Cluster health checks
- Topic throughput and lag monitoring via ksqlDB
- End-to-end functional testing with mock consumers and producers

---

## Production Deployment

Production deployment options include:
- Docker Compose for local or staging environments
- Kubernetes (K8s) manifests for scalable, containerized production deployments
- Integrated health checks and probes to ensure service uptime
